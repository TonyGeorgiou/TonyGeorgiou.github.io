<p>Collage may be one of the new kids on the block in the long history of art, but its impact on visual communication has been immense. Ever since Picasso stuck a little department store label onto a piece of ochre-coloured paper, painted on it and sketched over it extending his lines of ink beyond the label's bounds, collage has stuck itself deeply onto our aesthetic taste.</p>
